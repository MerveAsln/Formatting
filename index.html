        <p>
          &#128073; In Html, forexample, the
          <code><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b></code> element is a semantic element, which
          gives the tags it wraps around the tool or a top level heading on your
          page.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary><mark>Here is a top level heading</mark></summary>
          Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Omnis, quis
          dolores? Ea commodi quae atque cupiditate, fuga dicta at vitae ut
          ipsam eos delectus maiores minus dolorum quos labore sed?
        </details>
        <p>
          &#128073; By default most Browser’s user agent stylesheet will style
          an <code><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b></code> with a large font size to make it
          look like a heading ( although you could style it to look like
          anything you wanted) On the other hand you could make any element look
          like a top level heading
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary><mark>Consider the following </mark></summary>
          Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Omnis, quis
          dolores? Ea commodi quae atque cupiditate, fuga dicta at vitae ut
          ipsam eos delectus maiores minus dolorum quos labore sed?
        </details>
        <p>
          &#8680;This will render it to look like top level heading but it has
          no semantics value, so it will not get any extra benefis as describe
          above. It is therefore a good idea to use to right html element for
          the right job.
        </p>
        &#8680; Html should be coded to represent the data that will be
        populeted and not based on its default presentation styling.
        Presentation ( How it should look ) is the responsibility of CSS.

        to page and index to content found. When you search, the search engine
        displays the indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. If you follow those
        rules closely when doing SEO for a website , you give the site the best
